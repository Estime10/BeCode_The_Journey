# BeCode_The_Journey
## Welcome to My Web Development Journey!

>Hi there! I'm thrilled to share my journey as a web developer. I've always been interested in technology and how it can be used to create innovative solutions that make our lives easier. With this in mind, I decided to pursue a career in web development and started my journey to learn and grow as a developer.

>This repository serves as a collection of my projects and assignments that I have worked on throughout my journey. Each project showcases my skills and understanding of different technologies and programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

>Here's a list of the repositories included in this file:

- 1.The Field:    In it you will have a sneak peek of what I did when I first started my training
- 2.The Hill:     In it you will see more of my projects with better stacks then html/css 
- 3.The Mountain: In it you will notice that there is just one small project but I'm proud of it since It a full backend little something I did alone.

And more to come as I continue to learn and grow as a web developer.

I'm excited to share my progress and hope to inspire others to pursue their passion in web development. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for taking the time to check out my repository!
