# Description 
Empty up is an application that lists the empty buildings of a city. It is based on the community of people who are looking for places that upload and feed the site.  

The application is presented as a map where are pinned the buildings uploaded by all users with or without account.   
An authentication system allows users to have access to a profile and :
- to upload a building
- To comment a building and thus to update information about it
- To like a building and thus create a list of buildings to like/register
- Post an ad or view poster ads
- To get in touch with users who have commented on a building or posted an ad 

A search system allows you to filter the buildings thanks to : 
- The city of the building
- The type of the building
- The date of upload of the building 
- The most commented
- The most liked
